MEANT TO WORK ONLY ON BACTERIA!!!

The script select_putative_Circular_from_split_reads.pl select split reads from an
RNAseq fastq (single or paired) according to specific filters and cutoff.

To be selected split reads must:
- Map with 2 non-overlapping matches on the reference genome.
The 2 matches from the selected split reads must suggest a possible backsplice,
therefore they must:
- Be on the same strand but showing an inverted order.

The script takes in input, in addition to the fastq the:
- The path and name to the genome fasta indexed to run bwa
- A bed file with the map of the genes from bedtools
- A reference file with seqid and length of the sequence in the genome fasta
  to be used as header for samtools
- The paths and names of executable folders

Programs needed are:
- bwa-mem
- samtools
- seqtk
- bedtools

All the variable to set are present at the beginning of the script and should be
set before to start in the section:
# VARIABLES TO SET FOR FILENAMES AND PARAMETERS

The bed file with the genes coordinates should be prepared with the script
gff3_to_bed_only_gene_coords.pl run on the ensembl gff3 annotation of the genome

The reference file with seqid and length should be prepared with the script
write_reference_for_samtools.pl run on the genome fasta.
